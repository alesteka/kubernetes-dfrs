## üîê Security Risks and Mitigations.

### 1. Risk: Injection
*Mitigation:*  
In our application, we have implemented Django's querysets which implement query parameterisation to protect against SQL injection attacks (Django, N.D). By using The Django Object Relational Mapper (ORM) we avoid writing any raw SQL queries. Additionally, we utilise the built-in validators to validate and sanitize user input, ensuring adherence to specific regex patterns which are utilised under the hood. These measures collectively enhance the security of our application by safeguarding against malicious SQL injections and promoting secure user input handling.

### 2. Risk(s):  Insecure design + 3. Vulnerable and Outdated components
*Mitigation(s):*  
We added a [Django Dependency and Security checker](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/django-security-check). It scans the repo and helps to continuously monitor and fix common security vulnerabilities in the Django application. With this tool we can keep up to date with any changes to the tools we utilise in the project and update and or fix them if any issues arise. In addition to this we compiled `20` unit tests to validate the flows in the application  

These where some of the security issues identified in our Project:

After fixing the issues:

### 4. Risk: Broken Access Control
*Mitigation:*   
Using The Django authentication provider allowed us to implement role based access to the application. Using the `@login_required(login_url='employee-login')` decorators, we can __secure__ routes behind the authentication system and any unauthenticated users will not be able to visit them. Furthermore we added a redirect system for Authenticated users roles, `admin` or `employee`. Based on their role the authenticated user will be redirected to the relevant view where they have permissions.   

**Code Snippets**:
```py
#login decorator on route
@login_required(login_url='employee-login')
def someview(request):
    return render(request, 'this/this.html')
```

```py
# Role based authentication
user = authenticate(username=req_user, password=password)
# This will first check if the account exists before it tries to authenticate
if user is not None:
  login(request, user)
  if user.is_authenticated:
    if User.objects.get(username=user).is_staff:         
      # Redirect to the admin view
      return redirect('adminview')
    else:
      # Redirect to the employee view
      return redirect('employeeview', user_id)
```

A basic Ratelimitter is also implemented (Gaeddert, 2023). To implement this we made the assumption that a user who continually fails to login to the platform is trying to `brute force` their way in. To Mitigate this, after `5` failed login attempts the Users IP will be flagged and blocked for the next `60` seconds from performing a login action on the application. These repeated failed attempts are also added to the `Event logs` that notify the admin user. 

**Code Snippets**: `extract is from user_service/views.py`   
```py
def login_service(request):
  ...
  try:
    RateLimit(
      key=f"{get_client_ip(request)}",
      limit=5,
      period=60,
      cache=caches['default'],
    ).check()
  except RateLimitExceeded as e:
      systemEvent.critical(f"User with IP: {get_client_ip(request)} has been rate limitted, {e.usage} login requests failed",
                                initiator=get_client_ip(request))
      return HttpResponse(f"Rate limit exceeded. You have used {e.usage} requests, limit is {e.limit}.", status=429)        

```
In addition to the role access and ratelimitter, we have also included Session Invalidation. The current timer is `15` minutes of inactivty and the session token will be deleted and the user logged out and redirected to the login view.
```bash
# Session Invalidation
# Logout after a period of inactivity
INACTIVE_TIME = 15 * 60  # 15 minutes
SESSION_SERIALIZER = "django.contrib.sessions.serializers.PickleSerializer"
SESSION_EXPIRE_AT_BROWSER_CLOSE = True
SESSION_COOKIE_AGE = INACTIVE_TIME  # change expired session
SESSION_IDLE_TIMEOUT = INACTIVE_TIME  # logout
```


### 5. Risk: Security Logging and Monitoring Failures:
*Mitigation:*  
We Implemented a logging feature that logs/Tracks the following:

- When a user of the General Public submits a vulnerability report
- When a user attempts and fails to login, it captures their IP.
- When Employees login
- When Employees submit a vulnerability report  

The logs are only viewable by an admin user.

### 6. Risk: Cryptographic Failures:
*Mitigation:*  
We used The Django authentication provider which is a trusted authentication library. Passwords are hashed using SHA256 while utilising the PBKDF2 algorithm (Django, N.D). This ensures the secure handling of sensitive data. SSL/TLS are enforced on the Server which encrypts any data moving between the application and database.

## üßµ Multithreading & Concurrency.

### Multithreading
In Django, processing emails can be time-consuming and cause the application to halt until the process is finished. This presents several problems. For instance, on our deployed server, any process that exceeds 30 seconds will be terminated. To address this issue, we have incorporated multithreading into our application for handling emails. This approach creates a separate thread or background process specifically for managing email tasks. As a result, the application is able to carry on processing other requests while the email process is running independently.
```py
class EmailThread(threading.Thread):
    '''
    handle mutihreading for emails
    '''
    def __init__(self, email):
        self.email = email
        threading.Thread.__init__(self)

    def run(self):
        self.email.send(fail_silently=False)
```

### Caching
We next implemented queryset caching. By caching querysets, it helped reduce the number of database requests and the associated load on the database server, which should then improve its performance and allow it to handle more concurrent requests. 

**How it works:**  
1. On page visit/load, ee first attempt to retrieve the querysets from the cache `cache.get('systemlogs')`
2. If the querysets are not found in the cache (`None` is returned), we fetch them from the database `events = Event.objects.all()`
3. And then we store the data in the cache `cache.set('systemlogs', events)`

```py
def systemlogsview(request):
    '''
    The System Logs View
    '''
    events = cache.get('systemlogs')
    if events is None:
        events = Event.objects.all()
        cache.set('systemlogs', events)

    context = {'events': events}
    return render(request, 'adminview/eventlogs.html', context)
```
**Issue, Problem & Solution witch Caching**  
But we then ran into a problem. Since we were caching the data (cache default timeout is `300` seconds) if any new data came through, the user would not be able to view the updated data (Redis, N.D.). To remedy this we utilised The Django signal receiver decorator to listen for when the Model Changed, if the Model changed, the cache would be immediately deleted so that a new call to the Database can be made.

```py
# Signal receivers to update cache on save or delete events
@receiver([post_save, post_delete], sender=Event)
def update_systemlogs_cache(sender, **kwargs):
    cache.delete('systemlogs')
```

## Testing & Linters
### üß™ Testing
We created about `20` Tests, we tried to cover the most important functionality of our domain, such as:
- Login Functionality - does a user get redirected to the correct views based on their `role`?
- CRUD `creating employees`, `updating reports`, `deleting reports`  and so forth
- Views, are the correct views being rendered?   
- Ratelimit functionality
- IP address - does this capture the correct IP address value?   

All `20` Tests are currently passingüß™.  
![Alt text](security_images/tests.png)  

Our Current Test Coverage is `72%`.  _See [Testing](#:test_tube:-testing) section for more on coverage_   
![Alt text](security_images/coverage.png)

### Linters
Our chosen `Linter` for this project was [Pylint](https://pypi.org/project/pylint/). The chosen code `Formatter` was [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), previously it was Pep8 but we had some issues with it formatting the code.  
We utilised the Linter with a few modifications. 

1. `.pylintrc` file. This was so we could ignore the Default Django files and any other files that would not need to be Linted. Also we used it to configure our preferred indent space, `default` is `2` but we utilise `4` spaces.
2. Instead of having the output in the terminal, we made use of [Pylint-Report](https://pypi.org/project/pylint-report/). This allowed us to set the pylint output to json and then convert the json output to a HTML file, which allowed for easy viewing of the `pylint` output.

Pylint Report - See `pylint_output/pylint_report.html` the detailed output.
